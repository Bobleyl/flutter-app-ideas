# StartUp Name Generator

Create a simple application that displays 10 random startup name suggestions.  This is the first project that the Flutter Docs suggest doing.  If you get stuck and are not sure how to complete the app, you can always refer back to the tutorial in the [Flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab) documentation.
